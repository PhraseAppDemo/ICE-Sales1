          title: And You?
      phraseapp-story-1: “We should have the platform available in 4 weeks!”, our
        investor told us at the travel booking platform we were building. Then he
        added, "It must be available in 24 languages." Our team at the time was experienced
        in developing software for fast-growing startups, but this kind of pace in
        internationalization was rapid even for us. Our search for a product that
        could facilitate the localization of our software at this scale was fruitless.
        Finally, we decided to build an application to enable our translators to localize
        our web templates in-place while browsing our booking platform. The in-place
        editing instantly sped up our process and eventually became the foundation
        of our In-Context Editor.
      phraseapp-story-2: We showed it to fellow developers and received lots of positive
        feedback, and they told us that they would love to use it in their projects.
        So, in late 2011 the idea to build a localization platform from the tools
        we had created blossomed into a prototype for PhraseApp.
      phraseapp-story-3: 'A year later we had a growing number of customers, and we
        expanded the tool to become a platform, offering API clients, integration
        tools and workflow support for the complete localization process. Our objective
        became clear: We need to solve localization for software developers and strive
        for even simpler solutions for the typical tasks of localization managers
        and translators of software alike.'
      phraseapp-story-4: 'This is what we are here for and will continue to do: We
        constantly aim to eliminate unnecessary steps from localization processes
        and make software localization simpler in every way. PhraseApp is growing
        rapidly and now serves hundreds of businesses in over 60 countries.'

          p_1: Aiming to strengthen its market-leading position and bring its application
            suite to a larger global audience, Cvent launched an organization-wide
            effort to localize its products worldwide. Therefore, Cvent needed an
            efficient and effective way for developers, copywriters and translators
            to collaborate on localization projects – and PhraseApp was the answer.
          p_10: The software provider set about looking for a new tool to centralize
            translation management across its entire organization – a solution that
            could provide automation, versatility, and simplicity.
          p_11: After evaluating a wide range of solutions based on these extensive
            selection criteria, PhraseApp resulted to be the most attractive all-in-one,
            web-based localization platform.
          p_11_1: "“We dug into the problem domain with more than a dozen vendors,”
            recalls Michael Stemle. “We looked at all of the things they supported,
            and all of the things we needed, and we found that PhraseApp more than
            met our requirements.”"
          p_11_2: 'However, the deciding factor was the collaborative approach of
            the PhraseApp team. Michael Stemle explains: “During the demos, we found
            that PhraseApp was super responsive in answering our questions, and they
            were willing to work with us on our specific challenges. It was clear
            that they weren’t simply trying to sell us a product, they actually wanted
            to help us succeed – we weren’t just customers, we were partners.”'
          p_11_3: By integrating the workflows of both technical writers and translators
            into a single, central dashboard, PhraseApp streamlines Cvent’s translation
            management and makes it clear who is working on what, and when. Additionally,
            process automation significantly accelerates localization and minimizes
            human error.
          p_11_4: 'Michael Stemle continues: “From the developer perspective, we found
            PhraseApp to be particularly intuitive and easy-to-understand. It also
            supports all the languages and file formats we use, and enables us to
            effortlessly switch between them.”'
          p_12: With PhraseApp, Cvent is transforming its entire localization process,
            from inception to release. The organization is set to achieve unprecedented
            levels of localization efficiency.
          p_13: "“We expect to complete the migration to PhraseApp within a year of
            closing,” says Michael Stemle. “We’re already seeing benefits and, once
            complete, we’re estimating time savings of as much as 30% for translation
            management thanks to the reduction in mistakes and confusion.”"
          p_14: The new, centralized management platform ensures that employees can
            effectively collaborate on localization projects regardless of location
            and time zone – putting Cvent’s 18 locale, 100 country internationalization
            strategy firmly within reach.
          p_15: 'Michael Stemle confirms: “With PhraseApp, we have been able to modernize
            our localization process and bring our suite of applications to a wider,
            global audience.”'
          p_3: In November 2016, Cvent merged with fellow industry leader, Lanyon
            Solutions, establishing itself as the market leader in meetings, events,
            and hospitality technology.
          p_4: Keen to protect its dominant market position and seize new opportunities
            in the largely untapped industry, Cvent set its sights on serving a wider
            global audience.
          p_5: To realize this strategy, the software provider aimed to reach an ambitious
            18 languages across 100 countries.
          p_6: 'Michael Stemle, Jr., Principal Software Engineer at Cvent, takes up
            the story: “Our developers, copywriters, and translators are distributed
            all around the world, which makes collaborating effectively on localization
            projects very challenging; especially, because we didn’t have a centralized
            translation management platform.”'
          p_7: Relying on spreadsheets and decentralized internal tools can lead to
            considerable delays and confusion. Prior to PhraseApp, Cvent’s teams in
            different locations were confronted with a myriad of manual processes,
            increasing the possibility of  human error.
          p_8: "“With the new push to reach a wider global audience, it was important
            to our business that we worked on features at the same time as localization”,
            adds Michael Stemle. “For this reason, it was essential that our developers
            would be able to coordinate with writers and translators in real time
            to make changes to resources already in the pipeline.”"
          p_9: Additionally, Cvent’s translation management needed important translation
            management features, such as version history and in-context editing, making
            life particularly easier for both developers and translators.

              with farmers, workers, and brands all around the world to improve the
              lives of more than 8 million people. To help make this ambitious goal
              reality, three years ago Fair Trade launched a new technology unit with
              the aim of leveraging digital applications to streamline and enhance
              the organization’s work.
            p_2: |-
              One of Fair Trade’s most recent technology projects was to build an online portal for its supply chain partners. The portal provides partners with easy ways to provide information about available Fair Trade certified products, log transactions to stay in compliance with Fair Trade standards, and more.
               With partners located across 46 countries, delivering the portal worldwide was a significant undertaking – especially from a localization perspective. While Fair Trade focused on a few key languages for initial translation, they needed a system which could eventually provide localization in every country they serve.
            p_3: 'Bennett Wetch, Vice President of Technology Innovation at Fair Trade
              USA, explains: “We needed a system which could support translation of
              more than 460 keys into the languages of over 40 countries. As a non-profit,
              we have a lean team of developers and limited budget, so managing localization
              on such a huge scale through traditional means would have simply been
              impossible for us.” It was just as well then, that Fair Trade did not
              have to rely on traditional means.'

              localizing it for a global audience could have posed a challenge for
              the organization’s lean software development team – that is, if it not
              for PhraseApp. Fair Trade USA has been using PhraseApp for three years
              to efficiently deliver digital applications at scale. The software massively
              streamlines the localization process, to the point where a single Fair
              Trade engineer was easily able to handle the entire localization management
              workload for the new portal.

            p_3: PhraseApp provides Fair Trade with a host of features that help it
              to save time and reduce the cost of localization. For example, the intuitive
              user interface makes it easy for engineers to manage and moderate the
              product and its workload; and the In-Context Editor minimizes errors
              by giving translators insight into the context of the translation. Fair
              Trade is also gaining considerable value from PhraseApp’s flexibility.
              The platform enables the nonprofit to effortlessly share language libraries
              across different systems, and it can easily add additional languages
              without needing to restructure the code.

          '1': FAMILO is a specialist in location services for mobile apps. Within
            the last years, the company developed accurate, reliable and energy-saving
            geofencing technology.
          '10': "“PhraseApp exceeded our expectations. The software helped us streamline
            our localization and become an industry leader. The results speak volumes.”"
          '11': FAMILO used PhraseApp to localize its mobile applications into 16
            languages. PhraseApp enabled FAMILO to accelerate its user growth and
            to quickly launch its iOS and Android apps into those new languages.
          '12': Accelerating international growth with PhraseApp
          '13': As a result of FAMILO’s efforts to expand globally by using PhraseApp
            the team saw an overwhelming 400% increase in new users and was able to
            expand their business on an international scale. While FAMILO’s actions
            were comprehensive and strategic, the company also credits PhraseApp with
            giving them the practical tools to make tangible improvements. This outcome
            produced useful contextual information, made it easy to stay on top of
            the process, helped to reduce administrative expenses and to improve the
            the overall translation quality.
          '14': Localization displays a visible commitment to customers worldwide.
            Consumers expect products and services to meet their needs, which includes,
            most importantly, the language. It provides security and convenience for
            all parties involved. Plus, high-quality content transcends in international
            markets.
          '15': FAMILO gives families peace of mind with its sophisticated, smartphone
            app that answers the simple question, “Where are you?” This family network
            messenger lets you stay in touch with your loved ones easily. Receive
            notifications about where they are, what they are doing, and how they
            are feeling. FAMILO provides families enhanced safety and better communication.
          '2': PhraseApp helped to scale FAMILO's business internationally and automated
            the multi-language operations by easily and quickly integrating the localization
            process into their overall development process. The team experienced an
            overwhelming 400% increase in new users after adopting PhraseApp’s localization
            software. Moreover, FAMILO was able to improve the overall translation
            quality.
          '3': The challenge Familo faced
          '4': Despite astonishing achievements, FAMILO continued to spend most of
            its time and energy attracting new users to its application. The company
            needed a solution to connect with global customers worldwide. Like most
            businesses, FAMILO wanted to dig deeper to understand how to serve a larger
            customer base. The FAMILO team turned to PhraseApp to refine its product
            and expand its reach.
          '5': Tangible competitive edge is one of the best indications of business
            health. According to a Common Sense Advisory study, 56% of consumers find
            the ability to learn about a product in their own language more important
            than the price of the product. Localizing products increases the power
            of selling to your customers and gives companies an advantage in the global
            marketplace.
          '6': PhraseApp offers a translation management solution for web and mobile
            translation projects by easily integrating the localization process into
            the overall development process.
          '7': PhraseApp offered an integrated solution
          '8': To kick the project off, FAMILO’s team used the PhraseApp Translation
            Center to work with a group of translators. PhraseApp’s comprehensive
            documentation, integration tutorials and personal assistance made it easy
            to quickly integrate the localization process into their overall process.
            By automatically identifying the need for new translations, there was
            no more need to manually notify everyone about new translations. FAMILO
            was able to reduce significant administrative expenses by evaluating its
            upcoming tasks and keeping track of the translation progress. Moreover,
            the team utilized the advanced search features in order to quickly drill
            down on the entries that matter the most for their tasks.

        kreditech:
          '1': The PhraseApp platform helped fintech startup Kreditech scale their
            international business by automating their multi-language operations.
            Kreditech reduced their time to market when entering new local markets.
            Today Kreditech is able to support 30 different language versions across
            9 country markets.
          '10': 'Ricardo Vidal (Head of Product) about their PhraseApp integration:'
          '11': Since Kreditech has more than one product in some countries, PhraseApp
            eases the portfolio management by creating more than one locale for the
            same country with no effort. A fast  time to market is essential for fintech
            companies such as Kreditech. Each time the fintech startup launches a
            product in a new country PhraseApp is helping Kreditech save a large amount
            of time.
          '12': Kreditech easily integrated PhraseApp in its overall development process.
            PhraseApp helped to reduce their time to market for new products and markets
            significantly. Today Kreditech has a portfolio of multiple financial products,
            supporting 30 different language versions in 9 countries with ease.
          '2': The Hamburg-based fintech startup Kreditech aims to build better banking
            for everyone and currently operates in nine countries. It not only issues
            credit to private individuals, but is developing banking technology and
            supporting services. As the fintech startup scene is set for global expansion,
            Kreditech is in a privileged position, since it has proven an extraordinary
            time to market in new countries and it is now prepared for future stable
            international growth.
          '3': Kreditech used PhraseApp, a translation management solution for web
            and mobile translation projects, to accelerate the localization process
            and boost international expansion. Despite early success, Kreditech needed
            a solution to help scale their international business more efficiently.
            PhraseApp gives companies an advantage in the global marketplace as multilingual
            websites, apps and desktop applications can be easily implemented in multiple
            languages and are marketable more quickly. Hence, the barrier of entrepreneurs
            for internationalization decreases drastically. Companies are flexible
            for multilingual adjustments, so they can adapt more quickly to new market
            conditions.
          '4': After having released their products in the first few countries, the
            fintech startup discovered PhraseApp to automate its multi-language operations
            and expand its reach. It started using PhraseApp to accelerate the localization
            process and was able to boost international expansion. Initially Kreditech
            made use of XML files when handling localization, with a basic structure
            composed of sections, properties, and values. Everyone involved in the
            localization process had access to one single file. Developers, translators
            and project managers edited the same single file, often causing errors.
          '5': Translations made in the wrong locale or breaking of the document structure
            generated tremendous administrative overhead.
          '6': By using PhraseApp, Kreditech was able to integrate the In-Context
            Editor for the translation of strings directly on their web platform.
            Instead of just translating a set of ‘geek strings’, translators were
            able to grasp the context, seeing where the transition is actually placed
            in the application. This seems basic, but it helped Kreditech in handling
            the creation and continuous update of more than 750k words, saving time
            and costs as well improving overall translation quality.
          '7': Kreditech uses PhraseApp to monitor the current state of localization
            projects in real time keeping track of language versions, monitoring of
            tasks and orders, schedules and translation costs. With more than 30 different
            language versions, PhraseApp helped to keep all the localisation process
            organised and reduced administrative expenses.
          '8': Large localization projects usually involve many different parties.
            PhraseApp made it easy for Kreditech to collaborate with a large team
            of translators, developers and product managers. It was easy for them
            to handle their team of more than 60 involved users on PhraseApp, with
            different roles and access to the system.
          '9': A developer may have access to create strings in all projects, but
            a translator may only edit the translation copy in a specific language.

          p_1: With a rapidly growing customer base and a constantly evolving product,
            Livestorm’s localization process was struggling to keep up with the increasing
            number of text strings and locales. Aiming to accelerate, streamline,
            and centralize localization, Livestorm implemented PhraseApp. The intuitive
            new platform is helping Livestorm save time and minimize translation errors
            – and crucially, the PhraseApp solution will scale seamlessly as Livestorm
            continues to grow.
          p_10: PhraseApp consolidates all of Livestorm’s localization tasks into
            a single, easy-to-use dashboard. Translators can work directly through
            the dashboard, which completely eliminates the need for spreadsheets.  Similarly,
            PhraseApp enables a centralized, well-defined localization process, so
            Livestorm no longer has to worry about manually following a complex checklist.
          p_11: 'Robin adds: “With the help of PhraseApp’s Customer Success onboarding
            team, implementing the solution took less than two weeks. That is quite
            a feat considering how complicated our legacy process was when we made

            service in more languages and with more features than ever, without being
            held back by localization constraints.

            it much easier to release new versions and add new locales,” confirms
            Thibaut. “We’d say we’ve shortened the developer working time when adding
            new languages by 50%.”"
          p_14: PhraseApp is delivering time-savings through a host of features. When
            maintaining spreadsheets, there was always a risk of accidentally deleting
            valid keys; but with PhraseApp, that is a complete non-issue. Likewise,
            PhraseApp’s search engine and progress tracking tools make it easy to
            find particular keys or see what needs translating. Last but not least,
            with PhraseApp automating many of the processes that Livestorm developers
            used to perform manually, adding new languages is now significantly more
            straightforward.
          p_15: Most importantly of all, PhraseApp is fully scalable, so Livestorm
            will be able to keep enjoying all of the benefits even as the company
            size and scope of localization continue to grow.
          p_16: 'Thibaut concludes: “PhraseApp has already made it possible for us
            to double the number of people involved in localization internally, and
            that number should scale nicely as the team grows. It’s great knowing
            that we can expand the localization team without increasing the complexity
            of the process.”'
          p_2: When Livestorm launched in 2016, the majority of its customers were
            based in France and the USA – but it wasn’t long before it gained traction
            on a global scale. Today, Livestorm has customers in more than 40 countries,
            and catering to such a linguistically diverse user base is no easy task.
          p_3: 'Thibaut Davoult, Growth Engineer at Livestorm, explains: “The Livestorm
            app is available in 16 languages, and we’re adding more on a regular basis.
            At the same time, we’re always working on new features, which means more
            text strings that need translating. As the number of locales and the volume
            of text grew, localization became increasingly complex.”'
          p_4: Livestorm incentivizes its users and customers to help with translations,
            but it relied on spreadsheets to manually collect language keys from contributors.
            Without a dedicated tool, gathering the translations was a time-consuming
            task, and version control was particularly painful.
          p_5: Internally, the team developed a meticulous checklist to avoid mistakes
            while implementing a new language. Yet, as the scale of localization grew
            – with more languages, text strings, and employees involved – the checklist
            became more cumbersome than effective.
          p_6: "“Localization speed was becoming a problem,” continues Thibaut. “And
            developers were shouldering too much of the work load. We needed a way
            to accelerate and centralize the process, and we needed a solution that
            would be scalable as Livestorm continued to grow.”"
          p_7: After carefully evaluating several localization solutions, Livestorm
            decided to implement PhraseApp.
          p_8: 'Robin Lambert, Co-Founder and Product Designer at Livestorm, leads
            the localization team, and he was responsible for choosing the new solution.  Robin
            comments: “By far the most important selection criterion for us was ease
            of migration from our old system. The last thing we wanted to do was manually
            reproduce all our spreadsheet data. PhraseApp’s powerful importing tools
            and excellent onboarding team made it an easy decision.”'
          p_9: Livestorm was also impressed by PhraseApp’s user-friendliness, and
            its extensive format support. Robin’s team works with both i18next and
            Rails i18n, so format flexibility was essential.

          headline_6: Benefits
          headline_7: Easy to use and improve
          p_1: Consistently at the forefront of innovation, comdirect engaged Njiuko
            to develop a voice assistant skill for Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant
            that would enable users to query stock prices and exchange rates in real
            time. PhraseApp presented itself as the ideal platform for the new voice
            service. Not only can PhraseApp manage answers from voice assistants easily,
            it also helps comdirect accelerate the release cycle and significantly
            improve the overall language quality of the tool.
          p_10: For the voice assistant responses, the tool takes advantage of PhraseApp’s
            key and value based source code management. Each category of response
            has its own key, where numerous interchangeable phrases and sentences
            can be edited at one go. For example, when the voice service needs to
            confirm that it has received the user’s request, it would use the ‘CONFIRM’
            key. This key corresponds to an array of potential responses, such as
            “Okay”, “All right”, or “Yes, I can do that”.
          p_11: 'Christian Wendrock-Prechtl, Senior Vice President User Interface
            at comdirect, comments: “The response variety is extremely important to
            us. It significantly improves the overall language quality of the tool;
            it sounds more natural, which makes it much more engaging for our customers.”'
          p_12: What’s more, PhraseApp’s intuitive UI is so straightforward to use
            that comdirect’s non-technical marketing employees can easily add to and
            modify the keys without assistance from Njiuko’s developers.
          p_13: Importing or downloading locales and interacting with localization
            data in various ways through PhraseApp’s powerful API enables extensive
            workflow automation and facilitates easier collaboration. It is how PhraseApp
            is doing what it does best on top of the voice assistant integration -
            saving time and boosting productivity for Njiuko and comdirect.
          p_14: With PhraseApp powering its service, comdirect is enjoying a considerable
            head start in the new and competitive voice assistant landscape. As the
            launch partner for Amazon Echo and Actions on Google in Germany, comdirect
            is the country’s first bank to offer a voice assistant for the stock market.
          p_15: "“The voice service recognizes over 10,000 stocks,” says Christian
            Wendrock-Prechtl. “Whether they’re in a car or at the breakfast table,
            our customers can now query real-time market prices hands-free.”"
          p_16: The voice service is proving to be highly popular; and thanks to PhraseApp’s
            ease-of-use and process automation, comdirect can iterate rapidly and
            push out frequent updates to improve the service.
          p_17: "“We’re saving up to 2 days per release as a result of PhraseApp,”
            confirms Christian Wendrock-Prechtl."
          p_18: Njiuko has also been able to transfer full control of the voice service
            over to comdirect. At first, Njiuko’s engineers had to provide ongoing
            support to keep the tool running and up-to-date; now, the bank can easily
            manage the entire service and add new content through the intuitive PhraseApp
            UI.
          p_19: 'Norman Timmler concludes: “PhraseApp is part of our end-to-end process
            in every project we undertake. Thanks to its smart features and format
            versatility, it’s been our central tool in making the voice assistant
            case happen for comdirect.”'
          p_2: After the 2017 holiday season, no one can doubt the enormous – and
            growing – popularity of voice assistant technology. Amazon reported that
            its Echo Dot voice-controlled device was the best selling product from
            any manufacturer in any category, and tens of millions of Alexa enabled
            devices were sold worldwide. Google Assistant is also stepping up its
            game, with an especially strong appearance at the latest CES tech show.
            Smart homes and smart cars are rapidly gaining traction, and it’s clear
            that consumers are hungry for voice assistants.
          p_3: Aiming to satisfy this new demand, and deliver the best possible service
            to its customers, comdirect Bank set its sights on building its own voice
            “skill” for Alexa and Google Assistant. This tool would enable users to
            check stock prices and stock market related news, allowing users to save
            their favorite searches as well. To make its vision a reality, comdirect
            engaged Njiuko – a leading Hamburg-based software manufacturer – to develop
            the voice assistants.
          p_4: When it came to building the application, Njiuko’s main priority was
            finding a tool to manage the answers of the voice assistants.
          p_5: 'Norman Timmler, Managing Director of Njiuko, explains: “We needed
            a way to file every answer in one tool and get rid of hardcoded texts
            in our codebase. This isn’t something that a traditional CMS is equipped
            for, so we knew that we had to think outside the box.”'
          p_6: Additionally, Njiuko hoped to find a way to add variety to the voice
            assistant responses, so that it would sound more natural and not simply
            repeat the same phrases every time it was used. And crucially, Njiuko
            wanted to enable comdirect’s marketing staff to manage and update the
            tool themselves, without developer assistance.
          p_7: Njiuko soon realized that PhraseApp could be the ideal solution to
            the voice assistant challenge.
          p_8: "“We’d been using PhraseApp exclusively for more than four years for
            localization,” says Norman Timmler. “It’s been an indispensable tool thanks
            to its powerful features, user-friendly interface, and its support for
            a wide variety of formats. And it occurred to us that PhraseApp can come
            to the rescue to manage voice assistant answers.”"
          p_9: It took Njiuko just two days to integrate PhraseApp into the voice
            tool workflow, and it was a perfect fit. Now, when the voice assistant
            answer is created it can be easily looked up in PhraseApp.

        the_conversation:
          '1': The Conversation is an independent source of news and views that are
            carefully sourced from the academic and research community and delivered
            directly to its readers. Their team consists of professional editors who
            work closely with university and research institution experts to unlock
            their knowledge for use by the public.
          '10': PhraseApp proved crucial to the whole process as it provided The Conversation’s
            team with a centralized and standardized place where developers and translators
            can collaborate in real time. PhraseApp’s intuitive UI allowed translators
            to quickly adapt, and API allowed developers to easily setup a process
            that pushes English phrases to PhraseApp. Once the workflow was established,
            the localization project was completed in less than ten weeks.
          '11': Furthermore, the option of simply uploading YML/YAML files and editing
            them online, proved vital to the team since they were using YAML locales
            format. This feature allowed them to automatically validate placeholders,
            prevent bugs, and set up new segments via the web interface.
          '12': "“PhraseApp's easy-to-use and intuitive collaboration platform made
            it an important trusted tool during our expansion into France.”"
          '13': Results
          '14': In just ten weeks, The Conversation and their monolingual development
            team have been able to launch in French. “It’s difficult for me to say
            how much developer time we saved since this was our first time to use
            a translation management system. But PhraseApp worked seamlessly and enabled
            us to quickly expand to a new market with no surprises or changes to our
            lean development practices,” said James Healy, Technical Director, The
            Conversation.
          '15': During the initial rollout, The Conversation’s l10n and i18n team
            consisted of 5 developers and 2 translators working full time for 10 weeks
            on localizing their 5-year old code base. After the roll-out the locales
            are maintained by only one developer and one French translator.
          '16': Currently, with the new Localization set-up, The Conversation is able
            to deploy the app several times a day and get translation updates within
            24 hours.
          '17': As for expanding to other languages, Healy continues, “We are now
            in a process of using PhraseApp for another language and, while the first
            process took us 10 weeks, we expect to cut that process in half.”
          '2': They aim to help rebuild trust in journalism. All their authors and
            editors have to sign up to their Editorial Charter. All contributors must
            abide by their Community Standards policy and The Conversation allow authors
            only to write on a subject on which they have proven expertise, which
            they must disclose alongside their article. Authors’ funding and potential
            conflicts of interest must also be disclosed. Failure to do so carries
            a risk of being banned from contributing to the site.
          '3': The Conversation launched in Australia in March 2011. Their innovative
            technology platform and development team is based in the university and
            research precinct of Carlton. In May 2013, they opened an office in London
            where they based their newsroom. They now have editorial newsrooms in
            Melbourne, London, Boston, Paris and Johannesburg.
          '4': Challenge
          '5': When The Conversation first decided to localize in French, they were
            already active in four English speaking regions. Their development team
            were all monolingual Australians, and colleagues who would provide translations
            were in Paris. With no prior experience with translation and localization
            processes, and more than 2000 keys to be translated, The Conversation
            team knew that a manual localization would result in a lot of overhead
            for developers and translators, with questionable end results. Thus, their
            Technical Director, James Healy, started a search for a single solution
            in terms of a Translation Management System that would provide them flexibility
            and easy management of the whole localization process.
          '6': The process for localization was a team effort in which several developers
            worked with James on evaluating several different TMS providers. They
            quickly identified several localization systems and prepared a detailed
            requirements document. “Our project is built with Ruby on Rails and we
            decided to store translations in the standard rails YAML format. It was
            very important to us that the translation management solution integrated
            with our automated build and that it added minimal friction to our development
            processes”, said James Healy, The Conversation’s Technical Director.
          '7': Solution
          '8': When it came to choosing a translation management system to work with,
            they had identified several different solutions. Amongst them, they selected
            PhraseApp because its API allowed them to easily integrate it into their
            automated build process and Slack. The Conversation´s Technical Director,
            James Healy, shares that “We evaluated a few different solutions on paper,
            but PhraseApp was the only solution we advanced to a trial phase. I wanted
            to add as little friction as possible to our lean development, and PhraseApp’s
            API gave us exactly that.”
          '9': Within PhraseApp, James has a quick and easy access into the localization
            process. Using PhraseApp’s comprehensive dashboard for all current translation
            projects, he can keep track of progress and communicate with both developers
            and translators. Slack integration further ensures that the whole team
            is kept informed of all new activities and projects.

            online transportation marketplace which serves freight, household goods
            and vehicle shipping markets. Consumers and businesses can compare and
            book upfront quotes, name their own price or receive auction-style bids
            from over 800,000 customer reviewed service providers, ranging from independent
            owner-operators to the largest freight carriers and brokers.
          '10': No translator-controlled in-app preview.
          '11': With more than 20,000 content keys and RFC-4646 language identification
            tags understood only by a few current employees, something had to be done
            to alleviate the above issues and help uShip's transition to a microservices
            architecture.
          '12': Solution
          '13': When uShip began investigating the market for a solution to replace
            its in-house l10n and i18n tool, it didn't take long for them to find
            several solutions. Being a continuous integration and continuous deployment
            shop, each time a developer would commit his code to the version control
            system, the code would be built, tested, and deployed into all uShip's
            pre-production and production systems.
          '14': 'The solution had to meet the following criteria:'
          '15': Enable partner-specific terminology via “custom locales”
          '16': Explicitly model translator workflow
          '17': Provide an audit mechanism
          '18': Provide reliable and translator-controlled continuous deployment integration
          '19': PhraseApp stood out from 4 competing products with its well-designed
            web service API. From the beginning, PhraseApp proved to be an “API first”
            product which appealed to uShip's developers who also relied heavily on
            their own public API. What they quickly learned is that the web service
            API was not limited to uploading and downloading resource files. In contrast
            to the competing offerings, PhraseApp’s API offered a RESTful representation
            of keys, tags, and locales, together with the ability to discover fine-grained
            changes to translations. uShip's CTO Nick Parker and his team of advisors
            and consultants unanimously concurred that PhraseApp was the right choice.
          '2': Launched in 2004, Austin-based uShip operates globally with localized
            sites in the U.S., Canada, The Netherlands, UK, Germany, France, Spain,
            Austria, the European Union and Latin America.
          '20': "“PhraseApp is the most developer friendly and continuous-deployment
            friendly solution on the market. From the moment we started searching
            for a solution, PhraseApp quickly stood out from the crowd.”"
          '23': Results
          '24': In under 3 months, uShip successfully replaced its custom, legacy
            localization tool with PhraseApp. “The most time-consuming part of the
            process wasn't the integration of PhraseApp. That was the easy part. The
            hard part was understanding and reworking the existing old code that relied
            on idiosyncrasies of the preexisting system,” said Ed Vinyard, uShip’s
            Software Architect responsible for transition to a microservices architecture.
          '25': When asked about how much time their editors and translators are saving
            with PhraseApp, Vinyard said, “A lot,” and continues, “Our lead translator
            doesn't need to copy and paste each translated key into our homemade solution
            anymore. PhraseApp’s translation memory feature remembers previous translations
            and offers matching results while translating which saves a considerable
            amount of time for our translators.” With PhraseApp, uShip's l10n and
            i18n Manager has a much better overview of all translators and their activities
            and has a clear audit trail of all translation changes. Additionally,
            translators have completely stopped using spreadsheets and are now able
            to reliably preview all changes and new translations in pre-production
            environments, as well as to control which ones are promoted to production
            environment.
          '26': "“It worked completely out-of-the-box, we were able to quickly integrate
            it with our automated development and it immediately proved its worth
            by supporting one of our company's key partnership.”"
          '27': Aside from saving a considerable amount of time for translators, PhraseApp
            also saves time for uShip’s developers. Vinyard said “My guess is that
            we saved months of developers' time just to meet our new specific needs.
            Even more if you consider the benefits we wouldn't include if we had to
            write the code ourselves, such as the improved search functionalities
            and great performance.”
          '3': Challenge
          '4': Every 30 seconds a new shipment is listed on uShip. From cars to cranes,
            freight to furniture, and households to horses, people and businesses
            use uShip because it's easy and affordable to price, book, and ship everything
            no matter if it's going local or long distance.
          '5': 'To support its presence in 18 countries and expansion to new markets,
            uShip created an in-house localization solution which was largely based
            on the .NET framework. This involved a bespoke web application and a storage
            schema for the final translation storage. uShip’s owntool modeled only
            the storage and retrieval of the data, but not the translator''s workflow.
            Translators--lacking a way to keep track of their work--and developers--lacking
            time to improve the tool--resorted to spreadsheets to keep track of their
            localization and translation processes. Although the tool served its purpose
            for a long time and required very little maintenance, uShip''s recent
            partnerships required them to localize into additional languages and enlist
            external translators to aid them with the process. Marina Parisi, uShip''s
            l10n and i18n Manager, quickly identified several key difficulties with
            its existing system:'
          '6': Poor representation of translation workflow
          '7': Poor usability for translators
          '8': Lack of change audit
          '9': Limited integration with continuous deployment

            XING helps people to connect with one another and look for jobs, new hires,
            expert advice, and business ideas. Headquartered in Hamburg, XING employs
            more than 1,000 people and generated revenues of over EUR 140 million
            in 2016.

          headline_5: Partnering for success
          headline_6: Benefits
          headline_7: Superior scalability, powerful functionality
          p_1: The leading social network for business professionals in the German-speaking
            market, XING provides more than 12 million members with a platform to
            connect and collaborate. A hub for job-seeking, hiring, news and idea-sharing,
            XING propels careers and drives business success in every industry.
          p_10: Above all, though, XING was impressed with the solution’s versatility.
            PhraseApp supports all kinds of software environments and it can be quickly
            set up to work with both small and complex projects. PhraseApp’s versatility
            – 38 localization file formats across various platforms and programming
            languages – is highly beneficial for XING, given that its services run
            on a variety of platforms and use a number of different frameworks and
            programming languages.
          p_11: A leading-edge translation management solution, PhraseApp offers many
            features – including a powerful API and an intuitive central dashboard
            – that are designed to streamline all aspects of the localization process,
            making it easy for XING to create and manage its translation projects.
            Delivered as a web-based service, PhraseApp is also highly scalable –
            easily capable of supporting XING’s increasing localization requirements.
          p_12: "“Our main goal was to improve scalability,” says Guido Behrenswerth.
            “And there is no doubting that we have met that objective. PhraseApp is
            up to three times more scalable than our old system: it can handle many
            simultaneous projects, locales, and a much greater word count.”"
          p_13: Additionally, with PhraseApp in place, many localization tasks are
            now much simpler than they used to be. Thanks to the API, it’s become
            easier for XING to create projects, add languages, upload keys, and update
            resources. New verification options have helped streamline the proofreading
            process, and automated suggestions simplify translation.
          p_14: 'As a result, PhraseApp offers improvements throughout the entire
            localization process, and it’s been well received by everyone involved:
            engineers, copywriters, and translators.'
          p_15: 'Guido Behrenswerth concludes: “Thanks to PhraseApp, we can expand
            our business and product portfolio without ever having to worry about
            localization. It’s a future-proof solution and we’re confident it will
            support XING as we continue to grow.”'
          p_2: 'As XING’s operations expanded, it found that its outdated translation
            management solution lacked the process streamlining and collaboration
            features required to meet evolving business needs. By replacing the aging
            software with PhraseApp – an all-in-one, web-based localization platform
            – XING has streamlined translation, simplified management, and enabled
            scalability. '
          p_3: For businesses operating in a multilingual environment, releasing new
            resources is rarely as simple as creating a single, native-language version
            – to maximize reach, localization is an essential step. Translating text
            into numerous different languages can be a time-consuming process; and
            without an effective translation management solution in place, localization
            can often delay the release of new products and features.
          p_4: This is something that XING knows all too well. With as many as 250
            resources needing to be translated into ten languages each week, the business
            relies on its localization management platform to coordinate its vast
            number of localization projects. And, with XING enjoying a strong growth
            trajectory, its localization requirements have steadily increased. As
            a consequence, the business network found that its translation solution
            was in need of powerful additional features.
          p_5: 'Guido Behrenswerth, Copywriting & Content Strategy Team Lead at XING,
            explains: “Our existing translation management platform lacked the scalability
            to meet the growing needs of our business, and it was beginning to suffer
            from performance and reliability issues as a result. Its heritage code
            would have been very difficult to maintain in the long run. It was clear
            that it was time to look for a new solution.” '
          p_6: 'If left unchecked, these issues would have risked delaying XING’s
            release cycle, negatively impacting the platform''s pace of development  –
            and XING knew that as its business continued to expand, the problem would
            only get worse. '
          p_7: XING wanted a new translation platform that was faster, more reliable,
            more functional, and more scalable.
          p_8: It looked at several different solutions, and – following a thorough
            evaluation process – the company’s engineers, copywriters and translators
            unanimously agreed that PhraseApp was the best choice.
          p_9: “PhraseApp stood out for a number of reasons,” recalls Guido Behrenswerth.
            “The quality of the product itself, PhraseApp’s willingness to listen
            to feedback and feature requests, and the quick and helpful customer support
            were all decisive factors in our decision. It also didn’t hurt that PhraseApp
            is almost literally our next-door neighbor in Hamburg."

        Notes on legitimation of the processing  and period of storage</h4>\n<h4>3.1.
        <u><i>Legitimation of the processing of personal data</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n
        \ Our processing of your personal data is legitimate if you have given your
        consent as stipulated in Article 6 (1) sentence 1 a) GDPR.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Under
        Article 6 (1) sentence 1 b) GDPR, the processing of your personal data is
        legitimate if such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
        with you or your company. This also applies to all processing operations which
        are relevant prior to entering into a contract.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Under Article
        6 (1) sentence 1 c) GDPR, the processing of your personal data is legitimate
        if such processing is necessary for compliance with one of our legal obligations.\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ Under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 d) GDPR, the processing of your personal
        data is legitimate if such processing is necessary in order to protect your
        vital interests or those of another natural person.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Under Article
        6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR, the processing of your personal data is legitimate
        if such processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
        pursued by our company or by a third party, except where such interests are
        overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.\n</p>\n<h4>3.2.
        <u><i>Period of storage and erasure of data</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  Any personal
        data which we collect, process and store will only ever be kept by us for
        as long as there is a specific purpose for such storage. Your data will be
        erased or its processing will be restricted as soon as the specific purpose
        for which they were stored no longer applies or they are not subject to contractual
        or legal retention obligations.\n</p>\n<p>\n  It is possible, however, that
        European regulations, applicable national laws or other rules may require
        us to store data which we have processed for a longer period of time. We will
        erase or restrict the processing of your data when these statutory data retention
        periods have expired.\n</p>\n<h3>4. Your rights</h3>\n<p>\n  For the purposes
        of the GDPR you are the \"<b>data subject</b>\"</b> of any of your personal
        data which we process. As a data subject you have the following rights with
        regard to Dynport:\n</p>\n<h4>4.1. <u><i>Right to request access to processing
        information</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  You have the legal right to request information
        at any time about whether we are processing your personal data. If this is
        the case, you have the right to be informed about the extent to which your
        personal data are being processed.\n</p>\n<h4>4.2. <u><i>Right to rectification</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n
        \ You have the right to obtain from Dynport the rectification of inaccurate
        personal data concerning you and/or to have incomplete personal data completed.\n</p>\n\n<h4>4.3
        <u><i>Right to restriction of processing</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  In certain circumstances
        you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.\n</p>\n<h4>4.4
        <u><i>Right to erasure</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  In certain circumstances you have
        the right to obtain that Dynport erase personal data concerning you without
        undue delay. The right to erasure does not apply if processing is necessary.\n</p>\n<h4>4.5
        <u><i>Right to be informed</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  If you have asserted your
        right to rectification, erasure or restriction to Dynport, Dynport must communicate
        any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing
        to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this
        proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.\n</p>\n<h4>4.6 <u><i>Right
        to data portability</i></u></h4>\n<p>\nYou have the right to receive, in a
        structured, commonly used and machine-readable form, any personal data concerning
        you which you have provided to Dynport. In certain circumstances you also
        have the right to transmit those data to another company without hindrance
        from Dynport to which the personal data have been provided. \n</p>\n\n<h4>4.7.
        <u><i>Right to object</i></u></h4>\n<div class=\"privacy-statement__highlight-box\">\n
        \ <p>\n    <b>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular
        situation, at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you based
        on Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. Dynport may then no longer process the
        personal data relating to you unless Dynport demonstrates compelling legitimate
        grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms
        or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</b>\n  </p>\n
        \ <p>\n    <b>If the personal data relating to you are processed for the purposes
        of engaging in direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time
        to the processing of your personal data for such advertising purposes. You
        can inform us of such objection by contacting us as follows:</b>\n  </p>\n

        \ </p>\n</div>\n\n<h4>4.8. <u><i>Right to withdraw the data protection declaration
        of consent</i></u></h4>\n<p></p>\n  If you have given your consent you have
        the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of your consent
        does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
        The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any
        time.\n</p>\n\n<h4>4.9. <u><i>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority</i></u></h4>\n<p></p>\n  Without prejudice to any other administrative
        or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place
        of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing
        of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.\n</p>\n\n<h3>5. Visits
        to our website and creation of log files</h3>\n<p>\n  Our system automatically
        collects data and information from your computer system every time you visit
        our PhraseApp website. The following data may be then collected:\n</p>\n<ul
        type=\"disk\">\n  <li>Information about the type of browser you are using</li>\n
        \ <li>Information on the operating system you are using</li>\n  <li>Your IP
        address</li>\n  <li>The date and time of your visit to our website</li>\n
        \ <li>Information about the website from which your system has reached our
        website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The data which we collect on you are stored in
        our system's log files. As a rule, these data are not stored with other personal
        data. One exception to this rule is the information collected by us about
        your browser settings.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The temporary storage of data and log
        files is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. We have a legitimate
        interest in collecting and temporarily storing the data referred to, as the
        IP address must be stored temporarily by the system in order to provide the
        website to your computer. We also use the geoinformation to display an appropriate
        country website (e.g. for France: phraseapp.com/fr).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Data are
        stored in log files to ensure the functioning of the website. This information
        is also used to optimise our website and to guarantee the security of our
        information technology systems. Your log files are not assessed for marketing
        purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The data will be erased or altered in a way that prevents
        them being assigned to you as soon as they cease to be necessary for the purposes
        referred to here. Data which are stored in log files are erased after seven
        days.\n</p>\n<h3>6. Registration and login</h3>\n\n<h4>6.1. <u><i>Registration
        for the trial version of PhraseApp</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  To use PhraseApp,
        you must register using a form provided directly on the PhraseApp website.
        When you register you will be required to provide certain mandatory data in
        addition to voluntary information; these types of data are identified separately.
        They are in particular:\n</p>\n<ul type=\"disk\">\n  <li>Your user name</li>\n
        \ <li>Your name</li>\n  <li>Your address</li>\n  <li>Your country of origin
        or that of your company</li>\n  <li>Your e-mail address</li>\n  <li>Your phone
        number</li>\n  <li>Your password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  We process your data
        in this step in order to be able to provide you with translation management
        as software as a service (\"<b>SaaS</b>“) on the PhraseApp website. Processing
        of these data is necessary in order to establish, define the contents of or
        amend the contractual relationship between you and Dynport as well as for
        claiming and settling the relevant services. \n</p>\n<h4>6.2. <u><i>Login
        to the demo version of PhraseApp</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n Registration is not required
        if you decide to use the demo version of PhraseApp. The PhraseApp demo version
        runs exclusively on a PhraseApp test account of the company's own.\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ To use the demo version, you are asked for the following data in particular:\n</p>\n<ul
        type=\"disk\">\n  <li>Your name</li>\n  <li>Your company</li>\n  <li>Your
        e-mail address</li>\n  <li>Your request</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  The purpose of
        collecting your data is to enable you to try out PhraseApp.\n</p>\n<h4>6.3
        <u><i>Login for customers</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  If you register as a user with
        PhraseApp, you can store the following data, for example, in your user account:\n</p>\n<ul
        type=\"disk\">\n  <li>Your name (mandatory)</li>\n  <li>Your e-mail address
        (mandatory)</li>\n  <li>Your user name (mandatory)</li>\n  <li>Your nickname
        (mandatory)</li>\n  <li>Your company (mandatory only for Master Users)</li>\n
        \ <li>Address of the invoice recipient (mandatory only for Master Users)</li>\n
        \ <li>E-mail address of the invoice recipient (mandatory only for Master Users)</li>\n
        \ <li>Your address (optional)</li>\n  <li>Your telephone number (optional)</li>\n
        \ <li>Your payment data (optional)</li>\n  <li>The final four numbers of your
        credit card (if you pay by credit card)</li>\n  <li>The expiry date of your
        credit card (if you pay by credit card)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  We use, store
        and process your data in this step in order to be able to provide you with
        the translation management SaaS on the PhraseApp website. Processing of these
        data is necessary in order to establish, define the contents of or amend the
        contractual relationship between you and Dynport as well as for claiming and
        settling the relevant services.\n</p>\n<h4>6.4. <u><i>Legitimation, erasure</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n
        \ Such processing of data by Dynport is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence
        1 b) and f) GDPR.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We erase your data if they are no longer needed
        for the purpose, i.e. performance of the contract, and if they are not subject
        to contractual or legal retention periods. If you wish to erase your data
        yourself, you can do so at any time under \"My Profile\" – \"Delete User Profile\"
        on the PhraseApp website. The individual data are then anonymised so that
        they can no longer be assigned to you or your deleted user profile. Project
        data not containing personal data are retained, unless there are contractual
        obligations to erase them. Your (personal) data are no longer stored if there
        are statutory obligations to retain them.\n<p>\n</p>\n<u><i>Disclosure to
        third parties – Hubspot</i></u>\n<p>\n</p>\nIn some cases, we pass on a limited
        part of your data to HubSpot Inc, 25 First Street, 2nd Floor, Cambridge, MA
        02141, United States (“<b>Hubspot</b>”) for the purpose of customer communication
        and information (notifications about new feature releases, announcements for
        upcoming webinar sessions, etc.). \n</p>\n<p>\nYour data are transmitted by
        Hubspot to the USA. Hubspot is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield in order
        to offer an appropriate level of data protection: https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe
        do the above to improve our communication about the further development of
        our range of product solutions and to be able to communicate with you more
        efficiently when there are new features or essential information about common
        use cases for these product solutions. There are legitimate grounds for that
        under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou can find more information

        for the purpose of customer administration (chat requests as part of customer
        support, answering customers' questions, etc.).\n</p>\n<p>\n  We use Intercom
        for additional data analyses, such as obtaining information on the time of
        registration or user activity as part of customer support. Intercom can also
        be used as a communications medium, for e-mails or messages within the PhraseApp

        company, job title, website, social network handle and physical addresses,
        so that we gain a better understanding of our user base. Contact profiles
        are created in Intercom. To enable that, PhraseApp supplies Intercom with

        newsletter on the PhraseApp website. Our newsletter provides you with information
        on the PhraseApp software and translation solutions, new possible uses of
        them, changes to our services, or related services of Dynport for PhraseApp.\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ The data which you enter when subscribing to the newsletter are transmitted
        to us. These data are usually:\n</p>\n<ul type=\"disk\">\n  <li>Your e-mail
        address</li>\n  <li>Optionally other data if you disclose it</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n
        \ We need your e-mail address in order to send you the newsletter and to identify
        and check that you have given your consent. Any other information you provide
        is given voluntarily.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We use the double opt-in procedure for
        subscription to our newsletter. This means that, after you have subscribed,
        we will send an e-mail to the e-mail address given by you asking you to confirm
        that you wish to receive the newsletter. We also store your IP addresses and
        the time of your subscription and confirmation. The purpose of this procedure
        is to demonstrate that you have subscribed and to clarify any possible misuse
        of your personal data.\n</p>\n<p>\n  After receiving your confirmation, we
        store your e-mail address and possibly other data for the purpose of sending
        the newsletter. This processing is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence
        1 a) GDPR, since you have consented to receiving the newsletter. We erase
        your data as soon as you or we have ended the subscription for the newsletter.
        The subscription process is logged on the basis of our legitimate interests
        in accordance with Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. Our interests here are
        to have a user-friendly, secure newsletter system which promotes our business
        interests, meets users' expectations, and also allows us to document declarations
        of consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can cancel the newsletter subscription at any
        time by withdrawing your consent with effect for the future. There is a link
        in every newsletter sent to you which you can click to automatically unsubscribe.
        Alternatively, you can send an e-mail to privacy@phraseapp.com or a message
        to the controller referred to above in this Privacy Policy.\n</p>\n\n<h4>9.2.
        <u><i>Transmission of data to third parties</i></u></h4>\n<p>\nOur newsletter

        platform of the U.S. provider Rocket Science Group LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon
        Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA (\"<b>MailChimp</b>“). We use the order
        processing services of MailChimp.\n</p>\n<p>\nMailChimp can use the data of
        the recipients in pseudonymised form, i.e. the data are not assigned to a
        specific user, to optimise or improve its own services, such as to technically
        optimise mailing and for the presentation of the newsletters or for statistical
        purposes. However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter recipients
        to write to them itself or to transmit the data to third parties.\n</p>\nWe
        use Mandrill to send transactional emails to users of our translation management
        SaaS on the PhraseApp website. Mandrill is a product of MailChimp. Sending
        out transactional emails is necessary in order to provide services to our
        users. This includes emails with invitations to PhraseApp’s translation management
        SaaS, invoice receipts, important notifications about the PhraseApp usage
        or when users need to recover their password. \n<p>\n</p>\nMailChimp also
        processes your personal data in the USA and is subject to the EU-US Privacy
        Shield for this purpose (https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework) and
        so offers a safeguard that it complies with a European level of data protection.
        \n</p>\n<p>\nWe use MailChimp on the basis of our legitimate interests in
        accordance with Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. If you end your subscription
        or withdraw your consent to receive the newsletter, we instruct MailChimp
        to erase your data. \n</p>\n<p>\nYou can find MailChimp's Privacy Policy at:

        out on the PhraseApp website?</h3>\n<h4>11.1. <u><i>Principles</i></u></h4>\n<p>\nDynport
        performs various types of analyses on the PhraseApp website. The use of the
        analytical tools is covered by Article 6 (1) sentence 1 a) GDPR where consent
        is obtained in advance. If you have given your consent you have the right
        to withdraw your consent at any time.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo the extent that we did
        not ask for your consent, the use of analytical tools is legitimate as Dynport
        has a legitimate interest in using the various tools according to Article
        6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. However, you have a right to object at any time.
        We want to get to know you better so we can offer you exactly the service
        you want. We constantly want to improve our offers and measure the success
        of our marketing activities. We will only process your data for as long as
        it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which they have been collected and
        if they are not subject to contractual or legal retention obligations.\n</p>\n<h4>11.2.
        <u><i>Google Analytics</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  Our PhraseApp website uses Google
        Analytics, a web analytics service of Google. Google can be reached at Google
        Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
        Google Analytics uses cookies. The information about the way you use the PhraseApp
        website created by the cookie is usually sent to and stored on a Google server
        in the USA. IP address anonymisation is performed on the PhraseApp website
        so that your IP address is truncated beforehand by Google within Member States
        of the European Union or in other countries which are parties to the agreement
        on the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"). Only in exceptional cases is the
        full IP address sent to and only then truncated on a Google server in the
        USA. Google uses this information on behalf of PhraseApp's website operator
        to evaluate the way you use our website, to collate reports on website activities
        and to provide Dynport other services related to website and Internet use.
        The IP address sent by your browser by Google Analytics is not combined with
        other data held by Google.\n</p>\n<p>\n  In exceptional cases in which personal
        data are sent to the USA, Google is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield: <a
        href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework\" target=\"blank\">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ We use Google Analytics to analyse the use which is made of our website
        and to improve it on a regular basis. We will only process your data for as
        long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which they have been collected
        (in this case for creating and evaluating statistics). The data that we send
        and that are linked with cookies, user identifiers (e.g. a user ID) or advertising
        IDs are therefore automatically erased after 38 months. Data whose retention
        period has ended are erased automatically once a month. You can find more
        information on the terms of service and data privacy at: https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html.\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ You can change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being stored;
        however, you should realise that, in these circumstances, you may find that
        you are unable to make full use of functions on the website. You can also
        prevent the data (including your IP address) relating to your use of the website
        which are captured by the cookie being sent to or processed by Google by downloading
        and installing the browser plug-in from the following link:\thttps://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.\n</p>\n<p>\n

        <u><i>Google Adwords conversion</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  We use the offering from
        Google AdWords  (\"<b>AdWords</b>“), a marketing tool from Google. Google
        can be reached at Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow
        Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. AdWords is used to attract attention to PhraseApp's
        offerings by means of advertising (termed \"Google AdWords\") on external
        websites. We can thus determine and see how successful the individual promotional
        measures are in relation to the data for the campaigns. Our interest in doing
        that is to display advertising that appeals to you. AdWords also enables us
        to make our PhraseApp website more interesting for you. AdWords allows us
        to ascertain which campaigns you like. Ultimately, using this tool enables
        us to achieve fair charging for advertising and so use it as cost-effectively
        as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n  The advertising is delivered by means of ad servers.
        As part of that, Google uses ad server cookies which allow the success of
        advertising to be measured on the basis of specific parameters, such as how
        often they are displayed or clicked on by users. If you access our website
        after clicking on a Google ad, AdWords stores a cookie on your PC. This cookie
        usually becomes invalid after 30 days and is not used as a means of identifying
        you personally. The following are usually stored and analysed with this cookie:
        \ \n</p>\n<ul type=\"disk\">\n  <li>The unique cookie ID</li>\n  <li>The number
        of ad impressions per placement (frequency)</li>\n  <li>The last impression
        (relevant for post-view conversions), and</li>\n  <li>The opt-out information
        (indication that the user no longer wishes to be addressed).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n
        \ This cookie allows Google to identify your location and recognise your web
        browser. If users only visit certain pages of an AdWords customer's website
        and the cookie stored on their computer has not expired, Google and the customer
        can see that the users have clicked on the ad and have been forwarded to that
        page. A different cookie is assigned to each AdWords customer. That means
        cookies cannot be traced back by means of the websites of AdWords customers.
        If you have registered with a Google service, Google can assign information
        gathered from you to your account. Even if you have not registered with Google
        or are not logged in, Google may be able to find out and store your IP address.
        We ourselves do not collect or process personal data as part of these advertising
        measures. Google merely provides us with statistical analyses. \n</p>\n<p>\n
        \ You can prevent your participation in this tracking method by\n</p>\n<ul
        type=\"disk\">\n  <li>making the appropriate setting in your browser software.

        <u><i>DoubleClick</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n  The PhraseApp website uses DoubleClick
        by Google, an online marketing tool from Google. Google can be reached at
        Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4,
        Ireland (\"<b>DoubleClick</b>“). DoubleClick uses cookies to place ads of
        relevance to users, improve reports on campaigns' performance, or to avoid
        users seeing the same ad several times. Google uses a Cookie ID to record
        which ads are placed in which browser and so can prevent them being displayed
        multiple times. In addition, DoubleClick can record conversions relating to
        ad requests with the aid of cookie IDs. That is the case when, for example,
        a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later calls the advertiser's website with
        the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick
        cookies do not contain any personal information.\n</p>\n<p>\n  As a result
        of the marketing tool used, your browser automatically establishes a direct
        connection to the Google server. Integration of DoubleClick means that Google
        is notified that you have called the part of our PhraseApp website in question
        or have clicked on an ad from us. If you have registered with a Google service,
        Google can assign your visit to your account. Even if you have not registered
        with Google or are not logged in, Google may be able to find out and store
        your IP address.\n</p>\n<p>\n  You can prevent your participation in this

        it more attractive. The cookies collect data on how visitors use our PhraseApp
        website. These data are included in analyses and help us to improve our PhraseApp
        website. The cookies collect anonymised data, such as the number of visitors
        to the PhraseApp website, how they reached the PhraseApp website, and which
        websites they previously visited. If visitors to the PhraseApp website actually
        become a customer of Dynport, we use the data collected by HubSpot so as to
        be able to recognise them when they next visit the site and so directly offer
        them the service they wish whenever they visit the PhraseApp website. HubSpot

        <u><i>Hotjar</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n    The PhraseApp website uses the Hotjar
        analytics service of Hotjar Ltd. Hotjar, Level 2, St Julians Business Centre,
        3, Elia Zammit Street, St Julians STJ 1000, Malta \n (“<b>Hotjar</b>”) to
        improve its user-friendliness and the customer experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n    That
        permits tracking of the various ways in which visitors interact with the PhraseApp
        website so that it can then be optimised for the user. Hotjar also enables
        visitors to give feedback on the website's content: A small window is opened
        on pages of the PhraseApp blog and users are asked for their feedback on the
        blog article in question. Users can ignore this window or choose one of two
        response options and then leave a personal comment in a free-text field, which
        is then processed along with the response by Hotjar on behalf of Dynport.
        In some circumstances, Hotjar may also record your mouse clicks, mouse movements
        and scrolling. Keyboard strokes on PhraseApp's websites may also be recorded.
        However, the recordings are not carried out in a personalised manner and so
        remain anonymous. Hotjar uses a tracking cookie to collect and transfer your
        data. During your visit to a PhraseApp website, the tracking cookie automatically
        collects your activity data and stores them on the Hotjar servers. The Hotjar

        tool Mixpanel, a web analytics service from the provider Mixpanel Inc., 405
        Howard St, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA (\"<b>Mixpanel</b>“), to
        understand how our customers use our applications and to keep on improving
        them. The Mixpanel service is used to analyse the PhraseApp website by customers
        at the feature level. Mixpanel is used to gather information on which features
        of the PhraseApp website are used by customers and to what extent. Such an
        analysis offers a means to control planning as part of product development,
        since it enables the specific demand for features to be taken into account.
        The results of an analysis are therefore directly incorporated in the further
        development of the platform.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    Mixpanel collects and stores
        usage data in pseudonymous profiles. The pseudonymous user profiles are not
        collated with personal data of the person associated with the pseudonym. We
        use Mixpanel cookies for our products in order to record your browser type,
        operating system, language settings, the search terms you enter and your IP

        uses AskNicely, a product from AskNicely Limited, Lvl 1, 63 Ponsonby Rd, Ponsonby
        1011, Auckland, New Zealand (\"<b>AskNicely</b>“), for technical recording
        of customer and user feedback. When feedback functions are used, a connection
        to AskNicely's IT systems is established and the entered data are stored there.
        AskNicely is used to automatically send survey request e-mails in order to
        obtain ratings and other feedback from customers. To enable that, AskNicely
        is provided with us with customer information such as your name, e-mail address
        and customer number. When customers reply to such a request, information such
        as their e-mail address is used to contact them and, for example, to reply
        to a rating or feedback. The feedback and data provided are not published,
        but are used solely to improve the PhraseApp website.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    If
        users do not wish to give any feedback, they can click on the unsubscribe
        button located at the bottom of the e-mail that they received. If users specify
        an existing Facebook or Google account when they log on to feedback functions,
        a connection to the Facebook server or the Google or Google mail server is
        established and the data required for identification are exchanged. If the
        user is logged on to Facebook as a member, Facebook assigns this information
        to the user's personal Facebook account. That can only be prevented if the
        user logs out of Facebook before using the feedback function. The same applies
        to Google.\n</p>    \n<p>    \nDynport has a legitimate interest in obtaining
        feedback from customers in order to be able to tailor and improve its product
        range.\n</p>\n<p>\n    AskNicely will store your data on servers in New Zealand.
        According to the EU Commission, New Zealand is a third country that offers
        an appropriate level of data protection commensurate to that under EU data
        protection law. AskNicely is also subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield: <a

        uses the plug-in Jetpack from Wordpress (\"<b>Jetpack</b>“), , a tool for
        statistical analysis of access by visitors to our PhraseApp blog, from Automattic
        Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110-4929, USA (“<b>Automattic</b>”),
        which uses the tracking technology from Quantcast Inc., 201 3rd St, Floor
        2, San Francisco, CA 94103-3153, USA. The purpose of Jetpack is to analyse
        the number of visitors to the PhraseApp blog, create anonymised, aggregate
        access statistics, and to enable technical support for the search function
        in the blog (Elasticsearch) and SEO support. Whenever a data subject calls
        one of the individual pages on the PhraseApp website which is operated by
        Dynport and on which a Jetpack component has been integrated, the web browser
        on the data subject's information technology system is automatically prompted
        by the Jetpack component to transmit data to Automattic for the purpose of
        analysis.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    These data are primarily: \n</p>     \n<ul>\n

        behaviour (page views and clicks)</li>\n</ul>   \n<p>\n    You can change

        technology from Cloudfare Inc., 101 Townsend St, San Francisco, CA 94107 (\"<b>Cloudflare</b>“),
        to identify individual website visitors who operate behind a shared IP address.
        Cloudflare enables a visitor to be identified and security settings to be
        applied on a per-client basis. Among other things, Cloudflare can collect
        your IP address, your system settings and other information on your user behaviour,

        data to improve its own services, for example.\n</p>   \n<p>\nDynport has
        a legitimate interest in using it, since identifying individual users behind
        a shared IP address is necessary for security purposes. \n</p>\n<p>\n    Cloudflare
        transfers your data to servers in the USA and is subject to the EU-US Privacy

        <u><i>Facebook Conversion Pixel</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n    We use the \"Facebook
        conversion pixel\" from Facebook. The Facebook conversion pixel is used by
        Facebook Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA (\"<b>Facebook</b>“).
        The Facebook conversion pixel is not visible to normal visitors to our website.
        The Facebook conversion pixel is implemented in the AdRoll Smart Pixel and,
        after being created on the Facebook site, is then added to our PhraseApp website,
        on which the conversions are carried out. \n</p>    \n<p>\n    By measuring
        conversion, we are able to track – across all devices – what actions people
        take after seeing our ads on Facebook. That gives us insights into who responds
        to our ads and what they do after clicking on an ad. The Facebook conversion
        pixel tracks user behaviour. We then obtain measurements as to the success
        of our ads and so can adjust our marketing measures to reflect that.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    After you have consented to use of the Facebook conversion
        pixel by opting in, a connection is established between your web browser and
        the Facebook servers as soon as you visit the PhraseApp website. Facebook
        receives and stores data (including the IP address and conversions). This
        enables Facebook to recognise the PhraseApp website subpage you have accessed.
        The corresponding information is then sent to Facebook in the USA, where it
        is stored. If you are logged into Facebook at the same time, the transmitted
        data may be assigned to your Facebook account and linked to the data of that
        account. Facebook may use the data it collects on your user behaviour to place
        personalised advertising in your Facebook news feed. We point out that it
        is also possible for Facebook to collect your data even if you do not have
        a Facebook account.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    Facebook may share your information
        internally within its company group or with third parties. Information which
        is collected within the EEA may thus be transmitted to countries outside the
        EEA for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Facebook states that
        it uses standard contractual clauses which have been approved by the European
        Commission, takes other measures in compliance with EU law and obtains your
        consent to legitimate the transmission of data from the EEA to the USA and
        other countries.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    An overview of all Facebook plug-ins

        \  \n<p>\n    are sent to Bugsnag – depending on the severity of the bug –
        so that the bug can be analysed.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    In some circumstances,
        Bugsnag may also transfer the information to countries outside the EEA. Bugsnag
        will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate level
        of data protection is maintained. If Bugsnag sends your data to the United
        States, for example, additional measures are taken, such as concluding EU-compliant
        data transmission agreements with the data importer if this is necessary.
        Bugsnag participates in the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework.\n</p>    \n<p>\n
        \   Dynport has a legitimate interest in using Bugsnag since it enables PhraseApp
        to identify and remedy bugs as efficiently as possible.\n</p>\n\n<h4>11.17.
        <u><i>Bitbucket</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n   We offer the synchronization of your
        PhraseApp account with Bitbucket („<b>Bitbucket</b>”) for you as an optional
        PhraseApp service. Bitbucket is a software for a collaborative versioning
        management offered by Atlassian Inc., 341 George Street, Sydney, NSW 2000,
        Australia.\n</p>\n<p>\n   The synchronization between PhraseApp and Bitbucket’s
        versioning management enables users to export localization files from the
        versioning management software into their PhraseApp accounts. After being
        processed in PhraseApp, these localization files can be imported automatically
        into Bitbucket’s versioning management.\n</p>\n<p>\n   Under your activated
        synchronisation of Bitbucket and PhraseApp and localization files being imported
        from PhraseApp into Bitbucket PhraseApp will create an alias consisting of
        your personal data and pass these on to Bitbucket. In order to create this
        alias we process:\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>your account name</li>\n    <li>your
        email address</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n   Bitbucket will ask for this alias as soon
        as the import of localization files in to Bitbucket’s versioning management
        is initiated. A pull request assigned with the related alias will be created
        in the synchronized Bitbucket account in order to match all changes that have
        been made using the PhraseApp services with those changes made in the synchronized
        Bitbucket account.  \n</p>\n<p>\n   We do the above in order to improve our
        services and the PhraseApp usability. There are legitimate grounds for that
        under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR. If you have activated the synchronisation
        of PhraseApp and Bitbucket in your PhraseApp account also helpus us to improve
        performance of contracts, so such processing is therefore also legitimate
        under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 b) GDPR.  \n</p>\n<p>\n   In some circumstances,
        Bitbucket may also transfer the information to countries outside the EEA.
        Bitbucket will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate
        level of data protection is maintained.  \n</p>\n\n<h3>12. Social Media plug-ins</h3>\n<h4>12.1.
        <u><i>Principles</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n    We currently use the following social
        media share buttons (\"<b>plug-ins</b>“). Among other things, this enables
        you to share content directly from our website in your social media profile.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    If you publish data when interacting with our website via social
        media sites, plug-ins or other applications, that data may be publicly available
        and we may also be able to see it, depending on your data privacy settings
        in the Internet. You can control which data you wish to release by altering
        the data privacy settings which are available on most social media platforms.
        More information about how you can change your data privacy settings and how
        external social media sites handle your personal identifiable data is provided
        in the help texts on data privacy, the privacy policies and terms of service.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    We process your data to enable you to share our contents in
        social networks.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    The processing of data via social media
        plug-ins is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 a) GDPR. You may withdraw
        your consent at any time with effect for the future. In this case, data are
        also processed to enhance publicity for PhraseApp, which constitutes an overriding
        interest, and such processing is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence 1
        f) GDPR.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    We erase your data as soon as they are no longer
        required for the stated purpose and if they are not subject to contractual
        or legal retention obligations.\n</p>    \n\n<h4>12.2. <u><i>DISQUS</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n
        \   We use the DISQUS commenting system from DISQUS, Inc., 301 Howard St,
        Floor 3 San Francisco, California-94105, USA (\"<b>DISQUS</b>“). DISQUS allows
        you to log on either using your own DISQUS user account or existing Facebook,
        Twitter and Google Plus user accounts. If you have logged on to the DISQUS
        function on our PhraseApp website using your social media accounts, the providers
        of those services will also collect and process information on your use of
        the DISQUS functions. Please take note of the privacy policies of the respective
        provider. You can also leave comments as a guest, but then some of the functions
        are not available. \n</p>    \n<p>\n    DISQUS transmits the e-mail address
        of users, and the IP address used when a comment was entered, to Dynport.
        We need this information solely for contacting you in connection with your
        use of DISQUS, for example if we have to get back to you with questions on
        a user comment. This information is not transmitted to third parties without
        authorisation.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    If users write a comment on a website on
        which DISQUS is integrated, the comment and their user data are transferred
        to the DISQUS in the USA. DISQUS is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield for
        this purpose (<a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>)
        and so offers a safeguard that it complies with a European level of data protection.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    We erase your data if they are no longer required for the above
        purpose. \n</p>    \n<p>\n    You can find the DISQUS Privacy Policy here:
        : <a href=\"https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy\"

        \   \n\n<h4>12.3. <u><i>vimeo</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n    We use the provider vimeo,
        which is run by Vimeo LLC, 555 West 18th Street, New York, New York 10011
        \ („<b>vimeo</b>“), to integrate videos in the PhraseApp website.\n</p>    \n<p>\n
        \   When you call videos using vimeo on our PhraseApp website, a connection
        to the vimeo servers in the USA is established. Certain information is transferred
        to vimeo as part of that. It may include:\n</p>    \n<ul>\n    <li>Your IP
        address</li>\n    <li>Your browser information, such as language settings</li>\n
        \   <li>Information on vimeo cookies that have already been placed</li>\n
        \   <li>Information on the website from which you call vimeo's site and which
        you visit after watching a video on vimeo.</li>\n</ul>   \n<p>\n    vimeo
        stores cookies on your device, in particular the Google Analytics tracker
        (see section 10.2 of this Privacy Policy). This is tracking conducted by vimeo's
        itself and we have no control over it. You can prevent tracking by Google
        Analytics by using the deactivation tool Google offers for some web browsers.
        You can also prevent the data (including your IP address) created by Google
        Analytics and relating to your use of the website being recorded or processed
        by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in from the following
        link:  <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a>.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n
        \   vimeo also allows you to use certain other functions, such as rating or
        sharing videos. These functions are offered solely by vimeo and the respective
        third-party providers and you should carefully read their privacy policies
        before using the functions. Dynport does not obtain any knowledge of the data
        collected by vimeo or the third-party providers and has no influence on how
        they are used. Information about which of our web pages you have visited is
        passed on to the vimeo server. If you are logged on to vimeo as a member,
        vimeo assigns this information to your personal account. When you use the
        plug-in, such as by clicking on the Start button of a video, this information
        is likewise assigned to your user account. You can prevent that by logging
        off from your vimeo user account and deleting the vimeo cookies before you
        use our website.\n</p>\n<p>\n    vimeo transfers your data to the USA.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    vimeo may pass on your data to third parties. These are, for
        example, affiliated undertakings, business partners and advertising partners,
        who in turn use tracking technologies on the vimeo website.\n</p>\n<p>\n    There
        is a legitimate interest on the part of Dynport, as we wish to give a better
        understanding of PhraseApp's functions with the aid of integrated videos.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    You can find more information on data processing by and the
        privacy policy of vimeo at <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/privacy\" target=\"_blank\">https://vimeo.com/privacy</a>.\n</p>
        \   \n\n<h3>13. Use of Google Maps</h3>\n<p>\n    The PhraseApp website uses
        Google Maps API, a map service from Google Inc. (“<b>Google</b>”). Google
        can be reached at Google Dublin, Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow
        Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This enables us to display interactive maps directly
        on the website and makes it easy for you to use the map functions.\n</p>    \n<p>\n
        \   When you visit the PhraseApp website Google receives the information that
        you have accessed the corresponding subpage of our website. The following
        data are also sent to Google:\n</p>    \n<ul>\n    <li>Your IP address</li>\n
        \   <li>The date and time of your enquiry</li>\n    <li>The difference in
        time between your time zone and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</li>\n    <li>The
        content of the request (specific page)</li>\n    <li>Access status /HTTP status
        code</li>\n    <li>The amount of data transmitted</li>\n    <li>Website from
        which the request originates</li>\n    <li>Your browser type</li>\n    <li>The
        operating system you are using and its user interface</li>\n    <li>The language
        and version of your browser software</li>\n</ul>   \n<p>\n    This is done
        regardless of whether Google has provided a user account for you to log in
        with or whether you don't have a user account. If you have logged in through
        Google, your data are assigned directly to your account. You must log out
        before activating the button if you do not wish Google to identify you with
        your profile. Google stores your data as user profiles and uses them for advertising,
        market research and/or web design purposes. Any such use is made in particular
        (including for users who are not logged in) to provide tailored advertising
        and to inform other users of the social network about your activities on our
        website. You are entitled to object to the creation of this user profile:
        this right must be asserted against Google directly.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    It
        is simple to disable the Google maps service and so prevent data being transferred
        to Google by disabling JavaScript in your browser. However, we do point out
        that you will then no longer be able to use the map display function and the
        function of our website may be impaired.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    Google also processes
        your personal data in the USA and is subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield for
        this purpose: <a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.\n</p>
        \   \n<p>\n    The use of Google Maps is legitimate under Article 6 (1) sentence
        1 a) GDPR provided you have given your consent. You may withdraw your consent
        at any time with effect for the future. The use of Google Maps API is legitimate
        under Article 6 (1) sentence 1 f) GDPR as processing is necessary for the
        purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Dynport. We use Google Maps
        API to be able to offer you a map function. We will only process your data
        for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which they have been
        collected.\n</p>\n<p>\n    More information about the purpose and scope of
        data collection and the processing of such data by Google is provided in Google's
        privacy policy. This policy also provides more information about your rights
        and the settings which enable you to protect your privacy: <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en\"

        Disclosure of data to third parties</h3>\n<h4>14.1. <u><i>Principles</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n
        \   As a rule, we will only pass on your personal data in compliance with
        the applicable data protection laws to service providers, business partners,
        affiliated undertakings and other third parties.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    We may
        disclose personal data to service providers working on our behalf and require
        them to perform services in our name (order processing). These service providers
        may be affiliated undertakings of Dynport or external service providers. In
        this context we comply with stringent national and European data protection
        regulations. These service providers are bound by our instructions and are
        subject to stringent contractual limitations on the processing of personal
        data. Accordingly, data may only be processed if this is necessary for the
        performance of services in our name or in order to comply with legal requirements.
        We stipulate precisely and in advance the rights and obligations of our service
        providers in relation to personal data.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    We may disclose
        personal data to a third party if we are required to do so by law or in legal
        proceedings or in order to supply and manage our products and services. We
        may also be required to provide information to law enforcement agencies or
        other public authorities. We are also authorised to release data if the disclosure
        of information is necessary for the purposes of collaboration and thus of
        providing Dynport services to you or if you declare your consent to such disclosure.
        Disclosure can also rarely be avoided in the course of tax audits.\n</p>\n\n<h4>14.2.
        <u><i>Web hosting</i></u></h4>\n<p>\n    Our PhraseApp website and thus your
        data are hosted in Ireland by Amazon Web Services Inc., 410 Terry Avenue North,
        Seattle WA 98109, United States (in the following referred to as \"<b>Amazon</b>“).

        to do so by law or to comply with a valid and mandatory instruction issued
        by a government or regulatory authority. The data provided for this purpose
        are kept to a minimum.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    In some circumstances, Amazon may
        also store the information in countries outside the European Economic Area.
        Amazon will, however, take the necessary steps to ensure that an appropriate
        level of data protection is maintained. If Amazon sends your data to the United

        services to post payments. Where necessary to perform a contract, data are
        also transmitted to our payment service providers or the bank tasked with
        handling payment. The data are kept to the minimum necessary for the purpose
        for handling the contract.\n</p>    \n<p>\n    If payment is made by credit
        card, that is handled by the payment service provider Stripe Inc., 185 Berry
        Street, Suite 550, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (\"<b>Stripe</b>“). Stripe
        may only use the data in accordance with our instructions (order processing).

        payment services for Dynport if you wish to use PhraseApp. We erase your data
        if they are no longer needed for performing the contract and if they are not
